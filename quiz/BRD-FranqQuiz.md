## 9. Known MVP Limitations & Future Considerations

| # | Limitation | Suggested Evolution |
|---|-----------|-------------------|

| L-02 | AI opponents only (no real PvP) | Implement real-time multiplayer via WebSocket |
| L-03 | Correct answer always at index 0 | Randomize answer order at render time to prevent pattern exploitation |
| L-04 | Static question bank (80 questions) | Admin panel for question CRUD; expand to 50+ per topic |
| L-05 | No real authentication | Integrate with Franq Open Bank SSO/identity provider |
| L-06 | Leaderboard is simulated | Backend-driven real leaderboard with periodic resets |
| L-07 | Medal "Partida Perfeita" and "Top 3 Ranking" never unlock | Wire up actual tracking logic for these achievements |
| L-08 | Challenge mode uses random topic | Allow challenger to pick topic when challenging |
| L-09 | No push notifications | Implement for challenge invitations and leaderboard updates |
| L-10 | Coin economy not backed by real rewards | Define reward catalog (e.g., badges, gift cards, recognition) redeemable with coins |
| L-11 | Settings toggles have no real effect (music, notifications, privacy) | Implement actual music playback, notification system, and profile visibility control |
| L-12 | Hot topic is hardcoded | Make hot topic configurable (admin-driven, time-based rotation) |
